# Snowflake - Engineering Growth Framework

A modern, database-driven web application for tracking and supporting engineers' career development. This is a comprehensive fork and modernization of [Medium's original Snowflake tool](https://github.com/Medium/snowflake), rebuilt with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and SQLite.

## üöÄ Overview

Snowflake helps engineering organizations implement structured career development by providing:

- **16 Career Tracks** across technical and leadership skills
- **5 Milestone Levels** for each track with clear progression criteria
- **Interactive Visualizations** including the signature "snowflake" chart
- **Comments & Collaboration** on specific skills and milestones
- **Admin Dashboard** for user and access management
- **Authentication** with Azure AD integration for enterprise use

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This modernized version features:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and React 19
- **SQLite Database** with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- **TypeScript** for full type safety
- **NextAuth.js** for authentication (Azure AD + dev credentials)
- **Comprehensive Testing** with Vitest and Playwright
- **Modern Tooling** (ESLint 9, Prettier, Hot Reload)

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.x or later
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **SQLite** (included with Node.js)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbw16/snowflake.git
   cd snowflake
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
   ```env
   # For production (Azure AD)
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-ad-client-id
   AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-ad-client-secret
   AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=your-azure-ad-tenant-id
   
   # NextAuth configuration
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   npm run drizzle:push
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Visit the application**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Development Mode
In development, you can sign in with any username using the credentials provider. Simply enter a username (e.g., "dev") to get started.

### Production Mode
In production, the app uses Azure AD authentication. Users will be redirected to your organization's Azure AD login.

### First Admin Setup
To set up your first admin user, use the initialization API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/init-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "your-username"}'
```

## üìä Features

### Career Development Tracks

The framework includes 16 professional development tracks organized into 4 categories:

**Category A - Technical Skills:**
- Mobile Development
- Web Client Development  
- Foundations
- Servers

**Category B - Execution:**
- Project Management
- Communication
- Craft
- Initiative

**Category C - Supporting Others:**
- Career Development
- Org Design
- Wellbeing
- Accomplishment

**Category D - Community:**
- Mentorship
- Evangelism
- Recruiting
- Community

### Milestone System

Each track has 5 milestone levels:
- **Level 1** (1 point): Foundational skills
- **Level 2** (3 points): Developing competency
- **Level 3** (6 points): Solid expertise
- **Level 4** (12 points): Advanced mastery
- **Level 5** (20 points): Expert/leadership level

### Visualizations

- **Snowflake Chart**: Radar chart showing skill distribution
- **Level Thermometer**: Progress toward next career level
- **Point Summaries**: Total points and level calculations

### Collaboration Features

- **Comments**: Add comments on specific skills and milestones
- **Threaded Discussions**: Reply to comments for detailed conversations
- **Archive System**: Archive outdated or completed milestones

### Admin Dashboard

Admins can:
- Manage user accounts and permissions
- Grant/revoke admin access
- View all user reports
- Monitor system usage

## üîß Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server

# Database
npm run drizzle:generate  # Generate migrations
npm run drizzle:migrate   # Run migrations
npm run drizzle:push      # Push schema to database

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format       # Format with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check formatting
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
npm run test         # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Database Schema

The application uses a simplified database schema:

- **users**: User accounts (username as primary key)
- **user_roles**: Role assignments (admin, user, etc.)
- **comments**: Comments on milestones and signals
- **archived**: Archived tracks and milestones
- **report_milestones**: User milestone progress

Each user implicitly owns one report with their username as the key.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Development**: Simple username/password (any username works)
2. **Production**: Azure AD OAuth flow
3. **Session Management**: Handled by NextAuth.js
4. **API Protection**: All APIs require authentication
5. **Middleware**: Routes protected at the middleware level

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Unit Tests (Vitest)
npm run test

# End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
npx playwright test

# Test Coverage
npm run test -- --coverage
```

Test files are located in:
- `lib/__tests__/` - Library unit tests
- `components/__tests__/` - Component tests
- `test/` - Integration and E2E tests

## üöÄ Deployment

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Environment Variables

Required for production:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret
```

### Database Setup

The SQLite database is created in the `data/` directory. For production, ensure:
1. The `data/` directory exists and is writable
2. Database is backed up regularly
3. Consider migration to PostgreSQL for high-scale deployments

## üîí Security

- **Authentication**: Required for all routes except login
- **Session Management**: Secure session cookies via NextAuth.js
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in protection
- **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in XSS protection + sanitization

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
