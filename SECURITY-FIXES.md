# Security Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the Snowflake application.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Unprotected Admin Initialization Endpoint (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: The `/api/init-admin` endpoint allowed ANYONE to create admin users without any authentication checks.

**Impact**: 
- Privilege escalation vulnerability
- Unauthorized users could gain administrative access
- Complete compromise of application security

**Fix Applied**:
- Added authentication checks using NextAuth session verification
- Only authenticated users can access the endpoint
- Only existing admins can create new admins (except for the first admin when none exist)
- Added proper input validation for usernames
- Removed the dangerous default username fallback ("david")

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/init-admin/route.ts` - Added authentication and authorization checks
- `app/api/init-admin/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Added comprehensive security tests

### 2. Exposed Environment Variables (MODERATE)

**Issue**: The `.env.local` file containing sensitive Azure AD credentials was committed to version control.

**Impact**:
- Exposure of sensitive authentication credentials
- Potential unauthorized access to Azure AD integration

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `.env.local` from git tracking
- Created `.env.local.template` as a safe template
- Environment variables are already properly ignored in `.gitignore`

**Files Modified**:
- Removed `.env.local` from git
- Created `.env.local.template` with placeholder values

### 3. Deprecated Dependency (MODERATE)

**Issue**: The `ldapjs` package (v3.0.7) was deprecated and posed security risks.

**Impact**:
- Use of unmaintained security-vulnerable dependencies
- Potential security vulnerabilities in deprecated packages

**Fix Applied**:
- Confirmed `ldapjs` was not actually used in the application code
- Removed `ldapjs` and `@types/ldapjs` dependencies
- No functionality was affected as the package was unused

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Removed ldapjs dependencies

### 4. Database Configuration Hardening (LOW)

**Issue**: Database path was hardcoded and directory creation was not handled gracefully.

**Impact**:
- Potential runtime errors if database directory doesn't exist
- Less flexible deployment configuration

**Fix Applied**:
- Made database path configurable via `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable
- Added automatic database directory creation with proper error handling
- Maintained backward compatibility with default path

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/db.ts` - Added configurable database path and directory creation
- `.env.local.template` - Added DATABASE_PATH documentation

## Remaining Security Considerations

### npm Audit Vulnerabilities (MODERATE)

**Status**: Partially addressed
- 8 moderate severity vulnerabilities remain, primarily related to esbuild
- These vulnerabilities only affect development environment, not production
- Fixes would require breaking changes to build tools
- **Recommendation**: Monitor for updates and apply when available

### Input Validation

**Status**: Good
- Application uses Drizzle ORM which provides protection against SQL injection
- API endpoints have authentication checks and basic input validation
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding more comprehensive input sanitization

## Security Testing

Comprehensive security tests have been added to verify:
- Authentication requirements for admin endpoints
- Authorization checks for admin creation
- Proper input validation
- Error handling for security scenarios

## Deployment Security Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env.local` is never committed to version control
2. **Database Security**: Use appropriate file permissions for the SQLite database
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Session Security**: Configure secure session settings for NextAuth
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor security advisories

## Testing the Fixes

Run the security tests to verify the fixes:

```bash
npm test -- app/api/init-admin/__tests__/route.test.ts
```

All tests should pass, confirming that:
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected
- Non-admin users cannot create admins (when admins exist)
- Admin users can create new admins
- Input validation works correctly
- First admin creation is allowed when no admins exist
